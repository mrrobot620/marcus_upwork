# Suno Scraper




## How to Use

#### Download Dependencies (Only need to do once)

```python
  python3 -r requirments.txt
```
 
#### Run the script using this command. It will create a txt which will have the data key for all the music

```python
  python3 main.py
```
#### If you have lost your music file you can use this command to download all the mp3 which have been downloaded earlier. It will not need to scrape from websites as it will use the extracted data key to download the music

```python
  python3 main.py downloadFromFile
```
